# Daphne Ignores

# We always ignore these 4 types
# of files:
#
# - Dependancies
# - System/IDE generated files
# - Environment files
# - Build results

# Dependancies
#
# These should be installed on each
# system on initial clone. No need to
# bloat the repo by tracking them.
node_modules/

# System files
#
# No one needs your .DS_Store file or
# your IDE's project config file except you.
.DS_Store

# Environment files
#
# Not everyone uses nvm and devs should be
# free to use whichever Node version they have
# installed provided it meets the minimum 
# requirements for the app to run.
.nvmrc

# Build results
#
# Git repositories are for development code.
# We should be distributing pre-packaged, built
# versions of the app separately. In this case
# npm is the way to do this.
