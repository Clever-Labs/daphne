# Daphne

> A CLI marketing campaign generator

## What does Daphne do and why?

Daphne was created to standardize the way we generate marketing campaigns. Like many companies, we use email marketing, SEM, and PPC campaigns to advertise our services. Because each ad and campaign requires its own email and landing page, it can sometimes be tedious to copy over boilerplate code for our static HTML landing pages and emails.

We originally created Daphne as a script we put into our email campaigns project. Now we're turning it into a standalone project for use in any static HTML project. Daphne assumes you structure your project with a separate directory on your domain for emails and landing pages. Calling Daphne will create a new campaign folder and project files so you can start coding the campaign design immediately instead of wasting time copying over boilerplate and creating folders with sane, trackable names.
